# iPhoneChatRoom

To dos:

- Have time when text was sent and when text was read by other user
- Have area code be based on what state the user is currently in? (If not randomize it)
- Potentially reflect Wifi connection?
- Proper text bubble display (for opposition)
- Have the ability to add reactions when you click on a text bubble/"reply"
- If an hour passes, show the time within the messages?

Phase 2 - Add facetime?
